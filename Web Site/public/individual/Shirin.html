<!-- I'm a Software Developer majoring in Android Development and a full-time mother. I also have experience in QA Test Automation, IT Accessibility, and Assistive Technology. I love participating in hackathons. Recently, my team (4 ladies) won the "Best Pitch - Deloitte" prize for our project on Assistive Technology at "The Lady Hacks" hackathon happened in November 2016. Apart from programming I love to volunteer for elderly people and kids.
